- office politics and arbitrariness from executives (see next point)

- no meritocracy (being best buddies with the executives will get you promoted, in some departments worse than in others; being disliked or even speaking up will get you fired quicker than you can imagine)

- hire and fire > managers see you as perfectly exchangeable, regardless of your track record or experience in the company

- ZERO homeworking (the company owner ""doesn't believe"" in homeworking because he tried it once and it didn't work out for him, so obviously it won't work for anybody else)

- zero flextime (you have to arrive on the dot and stick to your break times), today also known as micromanagement

- the company owner has a rude way of communicating with his employees

- no insurances, 401k, pension plans, etc.

- managers often not ready to help you grow as a professional

- pay is comparatively low

- no or very limited growth perspective in terms of career development

- management is usually all over the place and often doesn't treat employees with respect

- this place will drain your motivation like no other (see next point)

- the company makes minimal effort for their customers, and management won't back you up in case you need to step up for a customer; you alone can't help your customers so in the end you just end up with a whole backlog of unhappy customers, when you are the first line of contact and get all the hate from them

All in all this is an initially ""fun"" place to work and collect experience for about a year, but then becomes monotonous and after a while quite toxic; you'll witness colleagues being treated unfairly and will likely start looking for another job soon if you're smart. Every high potential colleague quit the company at some point, the employee retention is extremely low, and the vast majority of people are job-hunting.

Code reviews are used for hammer down anyone the reviewer doesn't like. If the reviewer wants to hurt your career, he just has to write 400 comments in your pull request and make it so that it takes 10x longer for you to deliver. 

Drive-by comments on reviews are common. Specially coming from the God developers that look down on the rest. God developers are a couple of developers that have been there since the beginning of the project and have gathered so much political clout that they might as well be the owners of the company. 

Everything is super hierarchical. They even have documents on confluence describing the development structure as an army; With soldiers at the bottom, lieutenants, generals, etc,

Career progression is almost non existent unless you play the political game. The usual progression is developer->functional analyst->manager.

The only opinion that matters is that of the God Developers. A lot of them are part of the Core Team. You will be just a cog in a very dumb machine.

During the several rounds of interview, Deloitte told me there are innovation development going on and bla bla bla.. But after joining i realized there is NO project on that technology which i have learned and experienced for last 7 years. And they sold me to a client by telling that I’m an expert of another technology which client was demanding . Management pressurized  me to learn that new technology within few weeks. There was no training & guidance what so ever.  Like this they asked me to work on 6 different technologies in 9 months. Then i realized its the time to save my career rather than to stay for the shake of the brand ""DELOITTE”.

- Beware of the Kool-Aid: it's easy to buy into the idea of making an impact, staying at nice hotels, eating in fancy restaurants, being amongst ""the top"" and, that it's just too cool to be there. At the end of the day, you play a very small role in a large project, devoting almost all of your time and energy into this job. Yes, team culture is good, but start ups are better.

2022-03-16,Senior Associate Consultant in Brussels,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,V,-,V,"Toxic environment, period. Where do I start?
1. Feedback is never genuine. You could grind to improve on something mundane just to be beaten on it over and over. Once the hounds smell blood, you can never recover. Your cohort will dwindle and soon enough it will look like a season of survivor. This also harms the relationships you create while in Bain because it's just a long struggle and not something you reminisce.
2. The managers and the partners are mostly unpleasant. Mentorship is not genuine at all, there is no sense of collegiality, and there are no sources for support. When I first got in I couldn't get a 1:1 with my mentor for months, and everybody knew that the guy just doesn't like being there so what could I possibly learn from him or get help on?
3. Nobody has time, ever. Especially since COVID. Nobody has time to give you feedback or have a PD chat. Nobody has time to befriend you. You will be extremely lonely and just wait for it to end. Pre COVID this was different but the culture has not recovered.
4. Diversity not only doesn't exist - this place is openly discriminatory. I constantly heard misogynistic comments from managers and consultants, such as ""women don't do well in these interviews so we had to change them"", or ""women can't drive"". I really don't want to know what they have to say about non-white or non-straight people. Women are told that if they feel that their team doesn't want to hear their opinions, maybe they should stay quiet and learn.
5. HR, like in most corporate places, is a rubber stamp. Please don't go to HR if you have issues, and just try to stick around long enough until you find your next step.
6. Many people here get physically ill because of how much they have to work and how much pressure they are facing. It's not that hard to extend deadlines with clients or work more efficiently - but Bain doesn't teach you that. Instead, you will reiterate font sizes until your head drops on the keyboard. 
7. The up-or-out structure is not what it used to be. You don't get long severance anymore with decent time to look for a new place, and there is no real process to get you on track if you're not doing well enough. You just get a call one day saying you're done and good luck. Even the manager on your case might not know and you'll be the one telling them. Yeah they put you on a PIP but it's maybe 4 weeks long and there is 0 transparency about the whole thing. It has become a theme in this office that talent is not nurtured or discovered - their job is to find bros like them who will become abrasive managers and partners with the ability to squeeze any drop of productivity from the consultants and generate big buck for the firm.
8. Just to reinforce the pros - despite everything I said, go for it. stay for 1.5-2.5 years, that's enough, don't dig through reddit forever to learn that you need to leave as a manager. Get the fast learning of the first year and then start looking outside, there will be something waiting for you and I thank Bain for that.",Awful workplace but go for it if you can,"-Exit opportunities. Bain is Bain and if you made it in, you will have a fun, lucrative career that will be what you will make of it.
-Transfer opportunities. You can get a transfer to another office that might actually be a better experience.
-Learning. People here are very smart and will push you to be a great analyst. Additionally, Bain's international training programs are the best in the business, and the learning materials are awesome. If you have the time and curiosity, you can immerse yourself in fascinating insight.

In the intro month, they were swearing on an environment full of team orientation and coaching. Quickly, I realized that people weren't putting effort to help you out, instead you were rather being thrown into cold water.  
Instead, they were pressuring for perfection from you after explaining to you things once (being with the company about 6 weeks at that time). If you dare to ask second questions for further understandings, that would be discussed on your feedback as negative review (such as ""he isn't capable of understanding""). 

During my work I experienced seniors acting as managers, writing reviews which I couldn't do any more besides shaking my head about, such as ""he/ she didn't mark something in yellow"". Other seniors copying and pasting the same reviews into multiple feedbacks multiple times, regardless whether your knowledge and working hours for the company you were auditing was 50, 150 or 250 hours. Trying to  explain this to your reviewer (a manager), who is suppose to help you out and the only thing he says is “They are allowed to write whatever they want”, meanwhile me trying to explain that the knowledge and quality of someone’s work isn’t the same and rather improves, enhances and quickens if someone spends 50 hours on the project, or when someone has worked 150 hours, and again if someone has worked for 250 hours in the same project.

I experienced higher level employees acting as seniors, trying to pressure you, asking for things that really don't make sense at all, and ask you again to fix them the way you were thinking before, and at the end of engagement putting on your feedbacks that you are taking too much time to do your work. 

The CEO had inserted overtime to be approved by manager in 2016: With that in mind, I had directors and managers coming to me at 16:00 asking me for things that needed to be finished for the next day call with client at 9am, which leads to working some 3-5 hours over time. None of these hours were allowed to be charged. 
Other managers were only giving the time they had to be charged as overtime to certain seniors/friends only. 

At the very end, it comes down to sympathy and empathy towards to who you are working with. If you are lucky and you happen to work with someone you get along with, then you are sorted. Otherwise, it’s a lot of biting your teeth together and pray that the engagement is over sooner rather than later and you don’t have to work with this person again anymore. I experienced PwC as an injustice rather employer, where I saw people freaking out, crying, losing it (list can go on) in front you, witnessing discrimination towards your background and strictly showing within the team who their favorite is and who is somewhat worthless towards them. Would I ever do it again? Definitely no.",Moving forward with Sympathy only,"Looks good on your resume

A1 and interns are forced to come to the office every day. High risk due to the fact that these people come by public transportation. 
Badges are followed, emails are sent to people not coming to the office, it is a health issue and the long-term consequences of the disease are not clear. For me, this is absolutely irresponsible behavior. In case of health issues, I am sure that no one would take over responsibility. 
- the company tries to generate a growth rate of min 10% but the price for it is paid by its employees since the payment is lower compared to similar firms. 
- unnecessary, permanent pressure - too many feedbacks during one year, administrative work: expense reports, GTE reports is time-consuming.

I think the overall 'company culture' is stuck in the past, where kindness is seen as weakness and flexibility is seen as not doing much.

Completely inverted pyramidal structure: for every junior you have 3 or 4 managers. Some managers on the team have more power than others and their decisions carry more weight which leads to an environment of management by terror and continuous brown nosing to satisfy their whimsical egos. Work is not valued: juniors do the bulk, managers get the bonus. Forget about claiming your overtime: having it recognized depends on how big the manager wants his bonus. Lower overtime on the worksheet=lower cost = appereance of efficient management= better bonus. Partners are clueless, they say one thing, managers do the opposite and as they are the ones closely monitoring the teams, they are effectively imposing their will over partners' directions. Partners are almost never at the office, only come to read the report before sending it. People are fired for personal reasons and HR doesn't step up since the are terrified to open the sewer cover. Sect mentality, your whole life is expected to gravitate around the office. Not spending time out of the office with your work colleagues can be seen as an offense in some teams.

2020-11-26,Software Engineer in Luxembourg,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,X,-,X,"I arrived on a project where it was clear it was going to fail. I pointed out that there was no way we were going to make the deadline from day 1. The worst programming practices had been used for the project, and my co-workers barely seemed to have sufficient knowledge regarding the programming languages and frameworks used. The team lead often got offline at 3 PM and never gave clear instructions for the team. The project manager and other consultants left right before the project was about to blow up. The moment I finished the last bug in the backlog, I got a call from HR to say I was fired for bad performance.

I started applying for jobs, I was interviewed by companies that had worked on that specific project, they told me the environment was very political and they were aware the KPMG software engineering team was making bad decisions all the time. I was told I was the victim of a political fallout. I asked HR for an audit on the project which never happened. HR doesn't care whether you're actually performing good or bad. If someone wants you out you're gone, even if they're the ones at fault.

It couldn't get worse than this, KPMG tried to withhold all my salary until I gave them back the laptop and iPhone. But I was on vacation so I couldn't. I would have to wait almost 2-3 months for my salary to arrive. When I pointed out the article in the Luxembourg labor law, they suddenly complied.

After that they were still refusing to issue me my certificates necessary to apply for unemployment benefits.

After doing interviews for EY, Deloitte and PwC, KPMG is clearly behind its competitors in Luxembourg.

Don't lie about benefits, staff is not eligible for health insurance first 2 years of employment, and they're not eligible for pension plans the first 8 years of employment, yet it's marketed as if you're getting it from day 1. You'll also get a worn out iPhone as a 'benefit' as well as a company laptop you cannot use for personal use, which was also listed as a benefit.

Don't move to Luxembourg for KPMG if you value your career. I looked for work after being fired for 1 month and a half without success. I moved back abroad to a country where I don't speak the native language and found another job from my first interview.",Terrible place,"The onboarding experience was great, despite the COVID-19 situation.","Former Employee, less than 1 year",4.0,3.5714285714285716,3.8,4.0,3.5714285714285716,3.2857142857142856,lux,kpmg

Overall, I had a great time here - I made the experience, that management cares about staff, you are asked for your preferences and you are motivated to develop yourself and grow. I could make experiences working on different types of clients - from small engagements serving companies consisting of 2 employees, to big group audits in different industries with financial services being the main industry. Also I had the chance to work on different types of engagements - audit, regulatory, consulting and travel to other countries. 
In Risk Advisory a big focus is made on educating staff, there are several trainings offered per year and also I could gain several certifications. 
For me, this was a very good team to start my career.
