Not flexible working hours.

12,1.0,*,*,*,*,*,*,-,X,X,"They tell to employees that they are flexible, but smart working is not allowed and offices are in the middle of nowhere obliging employees to spend a lot of time in commuting and to compromise on the work life balance. They say that there is no hierarchy and that we can make the difference but at the end nothing can be done without the approval of really few employees inside the company. They do not train you, as a consultant you have to learn by yourself and you will find really hard time in having to teach a software you know from few weeks to customers paying hundreds of euros per hour. Salaries are really low compared to the other tech companies and inner mobility in the company for foreign employees is just a fairy tale: “if you are not a Belgian employee you will not have real career opportunities, or at least Belgian employees always come first”. Concluding, there is not a middle management and real career opportunities.

32,1.0,**,**,,*,**,*,X,X,X,"- no valuable training when you start: it's swim or drown 

- office politics and arbitrariness from executives (see next point)

- no meritocracy (being best buddies with the executives will get you promoted, in some departments worse than in others; being disliked or even speaking up will get you fired quicker than you can imagine)

- hire and fire > managers see you as perfectly exchangeable, regardless of your track record or experience in the company

- ZERO homeworking (the company owner ""doesn't believe"" in homeworking because he tried it once and it didn't work out for him, so obviously it won't work for anybody else)

- zero flextime (you have to arrive on the dot and stick to your break times), today also known as micromanagement

- the company owner has a rude way of communicating with his employees

- no insurances, 401k, pension plans, etc.

- managers often not ready to help you grow as a professional

- pay is comparatively low

- no or very limited growth perspective in terms of career development

- management is usually all over the place and often doesn't treat employees with respect

- this place will drain your motivation like no other (see next point)

- the company makes minimal effort for their customers, and management won't back you up in case you need to step up for a customer; you alone can't help your customers so in the end you just end up with a whole backlog of unhappy customers, when you are the first line of contact and get all the hate from them

All in all this is an initially ""fun"" place to work and collect experience for about a year, but then becomes monotonous and after a while quite toxic; you'll witness colleagues being treated unfairly and will likely start looking for another job soon if you're smart. Every high potential colleague quit the company at some point, the employee retention is extremely low, and the vast majority of people are job-hunting. 
Use it as a stepping stone and keep your guards up.","Nov 16, 2018 - Sales in Brussels",A stepping stone,"- good & fun atmosphere among colleagues, average age mid twenties
