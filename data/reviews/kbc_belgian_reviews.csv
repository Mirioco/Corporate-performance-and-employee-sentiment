11,1.0,*****,*,*,*,****,*,X,-,X,"For the Touch project:

Code reviews are used for hammer down anyone the reviewer doesn't like. If the reviewer wants to hurt your career, he just has to write 400 comments in your pull request and make it so that it takes 10x longer for you to deliver. 

Drive-by comments on reviews are common. Specially coming from the God developers that look down on the rest. God developers are a couple of developers that have been there since the beginning of the project and have gathered so much political clout that they might as well be the owners of the company. 

Everything is super hierarchical. They even have documents on confluence describing the development structure as an army; With soldiers at the bottom, lieutenants, generals, etc,

Career progression is almost non existent unless you play the political game. The usual progression is developer->functional analyst->manager.

The only opinion that matters is that of the God Developers. A lot of them are part of the Core Team. You will be just a cog in a very dumb machine.

No innovation going on at all. The work is brain-dead boring.
