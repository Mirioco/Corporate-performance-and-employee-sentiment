87,1.0,***,*,*****,***,*,*,X,-,X,"I arrived on a project where it was clear it was going to fail. I pointed out that there was no way we were going to make the deadline from day 1. The worst programming practices had been used for the project, and my co-workers barely seemed to have sufficient knowledge regarding the programming languages and frameworks used. The team lead often got offline at 3 PM and never gave clear instructions for the team. The project manager and other consultants left right before the project was about to blow up. The moment I finished the last bug in the backlog, I got a call from HR to say I was fired for bad performance.

I started applying for jobs, I was interviewed by companies that had worked on that specific project, they told me the environment was very political and they were aware the KPMG software engineering team was making bad decisions all the time. I was told I was the victim of a political fallout. I asked HR for an audit on the project which never happened. HR doesn't care whether you're actually performing good or bad. If someone wants you out you're gone, even if they're the ones at fault.

It couldn't get worse than this, KPMG tried to withhold all my salary until I gave them back the laptop and iPhone. But I was on vacation so I couldn't. I would have to wait almost 2-3 months for my salary to arrive. When I pointed out the article in the Luxembourg labor law, they suddenly complied.

After that they were still refusing to issue me my certificates necessary to apply for unemployment benefits.

After doing interviews for EY, Deloitte and PwC, KPMG is clearly behind its competitors in Luxembourg.

Don't lie about benefits, staff is not eligible for health insurance first 2 years of employment, and they're not eligible for pension plans the first 8 years of employment, yet it's marketed as if you're getting it from day 1. You'll also get a worn out iPhone as a 'benefit' as well as a company laptop you cannot use for personal use, which was also listed as a benefit.

Don't move to Luxembourg for KPMG if you value your career. I looked for work after being fired for 1 month and a half without success. I moved back abroad to a country where I don't speak the native language and found another job from my first interview.","Nov 26, 2020 - Software Engineer in Luxembourg",Terrible place,"The onboarding experience was great, despite the COVID-19 situation.","Former Employee, less than 1 year"

125,1.0,*,*,,**,*,*,V,-,X,"Horrible toxic culture fostered by toxic people. Arrogance and petulance are the law there. A culture of extremely long working hours completely out the legality. HR just close their eyes to the serious problems in some teams. As one manager put it once: ""we are a huge red flag for HR and they don't even want to know what's going on here"".  Completely inverted pyramidal structure: for every junior you have 3 or 4 managers. Some managers on the team have more power than others and their decisions carry more weight which leads to an environment of management by terror and continuous brown nosing to satisfy their whimsical egos. Work is not valued: juniors do the bulk, managers get the bonus. Forget about claiming your overtime: having it recognized depends on how big the manager wants his bonus. Lower overtime on the worksheet=lower cost = appereance of efficient management= better bonus. Partners are clueless, they say one thing, managers do the opposite and as they are the ones closely monitoring the teams, they are effectively imposing their will over partners' directions. Partners are almost never at the office, only come to read the report before sending it. People are fired for personal reasons and HR doesn't step up since the are terrified to open the sewer cover. Sect mentality, your whole life is expected to gravitate around the office. Not spending time out of the office with your work colleagues can be seen as an offense in some teams. Firm's management tries to compensate the horrible office culture and low morale and very lo compensation with imposted social events. Here monkeys, have some peanuts and work harder.
